# IT-proficiency
This repository is created for me to learn databases and SQL. Besides the *Media* folder, I'm creating my own [**Wiki pages**](https://github.com/AnastasiaZaiceva/IT-proficiency/wiki) to put all the necessary info there. 
On the 1st page the following topics are described:
- [x] Relational databases
- [x] Non-relational databases
- [x] Data types

On the 2nd page once can find the following info:
- [x] Main SQL statements and operations
- [x] Constraints
- [x] Stored procedures
- [x] Aggregate functions
- [x] Info about NULL values
- [x] Regular expressions
- [x] Aliases
