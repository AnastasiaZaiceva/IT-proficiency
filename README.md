# IT-proficiency
This repository is created for me to learn databases and SQL. Besides the *Media* folder, I'm creating my own [**Wiki pages**](https://github.com/AnastasiaZaiceva/IT-proficiency/wiki) to put all the necessary info there. 
On the 1st page the following topics are described:
- [x] Relational databases
- [x] Non-relational databases
- [x] Data types

On the 2nd page once can find the following info:
- [x] Main SQL statements and operations
- [x] Constraints
- [x] Stored procedures
- [x] Aggregate functions
- [x] Info about NULL values
- [x] Regular expressions
- [x] Aliases

> **Attention⚠️**: The Wiki pages don't reflect the complete information on the mentioned subjects. They're constanltly being improved and contributed to. 

## To be done:
- [ ] refresh SQL knowledge
- [ ] in my PGAdmin, create more complex tables, fill them in with data and create multiple-line quieries to deep dive
- [ ] do SQL tasks on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/tag/database/) 

> **Important ❗**: This ReadMe file is being written via *Visual Studio Code* and merged with GitHub *Pull requests*.
